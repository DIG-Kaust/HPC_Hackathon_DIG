## 2022 KAUST-NVIDIA HPC Hackathon

This repository is intended to document the project conducted by the Deep Imaging
Group (DIG) as part of the 2022 KAUST-NVIDIA HPC Hackathon.

The general idea of the project is to optimize the primal-dual based segmentation algorithm implemented by
Matteo Ravasi at https://pyproximal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/pyproximal.optimization.segmentation.Segment.html?highlight=segment.

The main code we would like to optimize levaraging GPU capabilities can be found at: https://pyproximal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/pyproximal/proximal/Simplex.html#Simplex

To ensure reproducibility of the results we suggest the `environment.yml` file when creating the environment.
